# Featuresüí´
- **Real-time Chatting**: Quirk Chat leverages the power of 'socket.io' to enable real-time communication between users. Messages are instantly delivered to recipients, ensuring a smooth and responsive chatting experience.

- **User Authentication**: The application includes a secure login and signup system. Users can create accounts, log in with their credentials, and access their chat rooms. Authentication is handled using secure encryption techniques.

- **Sign in with Google:** Users can easily sign in via their Google accounts. This was achieved by using Firebase authentication. After logging in with Google, the user must select their username and avatar. The application dynamically checks whether the current username is valid, and the server calls are minimized by incorporating debouncing.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Quirk Chat offers a responsive, intuitive, and visually appealing interface, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with the application. The design focuses on simplicity and usability, providing a pleasant experience for all users.

- **Persistent Data Storage**: MongoDB is utilized as the database for Quirk Chat, ensuring reliable and efficient storage of user information and chat messages. The use of MongoDB allows for scalability and flexibility, accommodating the growth of the application and its user base.
